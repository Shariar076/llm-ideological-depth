(2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the class action device that have--
(A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly;
(B) adversely affected interstate commerce; and
(C) undermined public respect for our judicial system.
(3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--
(A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;
(B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members;
(C) confusing notices are published that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights.
(4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial system, the free flow of interstate commerce, and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the United States Constitution, in that State and local courts are--
(A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal court;
(B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against out-of-State defendants;
(C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on other States and bind the rights of the residents of those States.
(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
(1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members with legitimate claims;
(2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance under diversity jurisdiction; and

It is a Federal guarantee that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed medical services.
(2) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and other services for the elderly and individuals living with disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other supportive services that are typically not provided by private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to maintain independence.
(3) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for more than 6,000,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid program spent nearly $40,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare services in 2002.
(b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the Finance Committee shall not report a reconciliation bill that achieves spending reductions that would--
(1) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a critical component of the health care system of the United States;
(2) cap Federal Medicaid spending, or otherwise shift Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their taxpayers and health providers, forcing a reduction in access to essential health services for low-income elderly individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and families; or
(3) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the health care safety net of the United States, but the entire health care system.","These excerpts were chosen because they specifically address the importance of Medicaid and its role in providing health care services to vulnerable populations. The 'Sense of the Senate' regarding restraining Medicaid growth directly relates to the amendment in question, which concerns Medicaid reconciliation legislation and aligns with recommendations from the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

(2) Tribal colleges and universities are located in some of the most isolated and impoverished areas in the Nation and are the Nation's most poorly funded institutions of higher education. While the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, or ""Tribal College Act"" provides funding based solely on Indian students, the colleges have open enrollment policies providing access to postsecondary education opportunities to all interested students, about 20 percent of whom are non-Indian. With rare exception, tribal colleges and universities do not receive operating funds from their respective States for these non-Indian State resident students. Yet, if these same students attended any other public institutions in their States, the State would provide basic operating funds to the institution. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that-- (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced by tribal colleges, and universities and assumes that equitable consideration will be provided to them through funding of the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, the Equity in Educational Land Grant Status Act, title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and Housing and Urban Development Tribal College and University Programs; and (2) such equitable consideration reflects Congress intent to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding authorization goals for tribal colleges and universities.","These excerpts were chosen because they specifically address the funding challenges faced by tribal colleges and universities, which is directly related to the amendment being voted on that seeks to restore funding for tribal programs.

(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the right of all citizens to vote, including the right to register to vote and cast meaningful votes, is preserved and protected as guaranteed by the Constitution. (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following: (1) Significant progress has been made in eliminating first generation barriers experienced by minority voters, including increased numbers of registered minority voters, minority voter turnout, and minority representation in Congress, State legislatures, and local elected offices. This progress is the direct result of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. (2) However, vestiges of discrimination in voting continue to exist as demonstrated by second generation barriers constructed to prevent minority voters from fully participating in the electoral process. (3) The continued evidence of racially polarized voting in each of the jurisdictions covered by the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 demonstrates that racial and language minorities remain politically vulnerable, warranting the continued protection of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. (9) The record compiled by Congress demonstrates that, without the continuation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protections, racial and language minority citizens will be deprived of the opportunity to exercise their right to vote, or will have their votes diluted, undermining the significant gains made by minorities in the last 40 years.","These excerpts were chosen because they outline the purpose and findings of the bill, emphasizing the importance of protecting voting rights and addressing ongoing discrimination against minority voters.
